    <p>
        Krypton's multiple emission lines make ionized krypton gas discharges appear whitish, 
        which in turn makes krypton-based bulbs useful in photography as a white light source. 
        Krypton is used in some photographic flashes for high speed photography. 
        Krypton gas is also combined with mercury to make luminous signs that glow with a bright greenish-blue light.
